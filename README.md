# LIVE_WEATHER-DISPLAYING-APPLICATION

Significant Technologies used -:
It is a Web Application that I've created using Django Framework for discovering the current weather of any valid city in the entire world.
I've made use of API taken from the OpenWeatherMap to access the live weather details.
I've used Bulma Framework for the css layout rather than Bootstrap or any other technology. It made my work really easy and attractive.

About the App -:
I have two sides of the WebApp. One is the Client side where a user can type in the name of any city and that city will be displayed below with it's current temperature in Celsius. He/She can also remove a particular city by clicking on the little cross sign that I've appended on top-right corner. The other one is the Admin side wherein the Admin can login and access & update all functionalities.
